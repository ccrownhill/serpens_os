# TicTacToe in an OS

Current state: 

1. Got Hello World bootloader to work.
1. Enabled user to type anything and see output on text (pressing enter will be like using a carriage return)
1. Got into 32 bit protected mode and printed Hi on third line with VGA text mode buffer at 0xb8000 to confirm that the switch was successful
